# 👋 Hi, I’m Tommy Vlassiou

Junior Cybersecurity Analyst based in Brussels.  
I’m building practical security skills through hands-on labs and projects, with a strong focus on **Azure**, **Microsoft 365 security**, **Entra ID**, **PowerShell automation**, and **SOC-style detection**.

Before cybersecurity, I worked in operational management roles, so I naturally think in terms of **process**, **reliability**, **documentation**, and **execution under pressure**.

---

## 🔍 Current Focus
- Microsoft 365 security (Entra ID / Exchange Online / Conditional Access / MFA)
- Detection & investigation mindset (SOC workflows)
- PowerShell automation (Microsoft Graph API, modules, scripts, reporting)
- Azure security basics (IAM, NSG, Key Vault, monitoring)

---

## 🚧 Main Project
### 🔧 M365 Security Audit Toolkit *(in development)*
A PowerShell toolkit to automate security auditing for Microsoft 365 environments.

**Goal:** quickly get visibility on security posture and export results as clean reports.

Features (current + planned):
- User & license inventory
- MFA status tracking
- Security group auditing
- Failed sign-in detection
- CSV exports + structured reporting

---

## 🧪 Other Projects / Experience
- **Python Port Scanner** (team project)  
  ARP/ICMP/TCP SYN scanning + logging + input validation + ethical test report.

- **Phishing Campaign Simulation (Orange Cyberdefense Hackathon)**  
  Social engineering scenario + malicious email crafting + analysis + awareness report.

- **Internship Developer — Belgian Senate**  
  Next.js / React / TypeScript (useful now for security automation + tooling mindset).

---

## 🛠️ Skills
**Security / Cloud**
- M365 Administration: Entra ID, Exchange Online, Conditional Access, MFA
- GRC fundamentals: DLP, retention policies, audit logs, ISO/IEC 27001 basics
- SIEM: Microsoft Sentinel (detection + investigation)
- Azure security: IAM, NSG, Key Vault, monitoring

**Automation / Dev**
- PowerShell (automation, remoting, modules, Graph API)
- Python, SQL, KQL
- Git / GitHub, Docker

---

## 🎓 Certification
