# 👋 Hello, I'm Tommy | Cybersecurity & Cloud Security Student

Driven by a strong interest in **cybersecurity and cloud security**, I’m currently enrolled in an intensive bootcamp focused on defense, detection, and secure architecture in modern systems.

I bring with me a background in **full-stack development**, which I now leverage to build secure, automated, and scalable solutions. My path is focused, structured, and grounded in real-world application.
